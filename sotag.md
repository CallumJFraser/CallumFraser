Hi and welcome, my name is Callum.

You have scanned my social media tag (SoTag)

Please check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/callumjfraser/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@callumjfraser) pages

Or feel free to continue to browse [my website](/).

I have always been frustreated with the 'dance' we all do when wanting to follow each other on social media so i thought i woudl make this SoTag to make it easier.

## FAQs
### How is it made?

I suspected some people might ask. It was made on my Creality K1C 3D printer and modelled using OnShape. Each social tag can take quite a few hours as I am not the best at the 3D modelling software and QR codes are fiddily.

Stil I think the outcome is worth it.

### Can I have one?

So far I have been making them for friends and people who's work I think is brilliant. So its possible that I would love too make one for you.
